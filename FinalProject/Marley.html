          <h2>About Marley</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Marley, aka JoJo, is the second-born of the MJ Squad.If she’s not stretched out in bed watching something on her phone, she’s probably in the mirror doing her hair and making sure she looks right. She’s a junior in high school now, and even though school keeps her busy, she still finds time to stay active and keep her love for sports going. JoJo’s got this energy about her that makes everything more fun—she’s always laughing, joking, and turning regular moments into memories. She’s the type of person who can walk into a room and instantly make it feel like a party. No matter where she is, Marley brings the good vibes, and that’s why everyone loves having her around..</p>
