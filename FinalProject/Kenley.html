          <h2>About kenley</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>My name is McKenley, but a lot of people know me as Kenley or Big Bacon I'm the first born. I’ve always had a passion for cars, clothes, and music, which really reflect my personality and interests. In high school, I played football and it became a big part of my life, teaching me discipline, teamwork, and determination. After graduation, I continued that journey and went to college in New Jersey for a year on a football scholarship. Even though my path has changed since then, football gave me valuable lessons and experiences I’ll always carry with me.</p>

         <p>My love for music runs deep, and I don’t think I could ever live without it. I’ve always appreciated every genre, and since I was a kid, I found myself drawn to older music rather than just my own generation’s sound. At the same time, I have a strong love for today’s music as well, because it constantly finds new ways to reshape history while still honoring the past.Although, this was hard these are my top three songs ever</p>
