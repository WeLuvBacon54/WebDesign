          <h2>About Myles</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Myles is the third-born of the MJ Squad, and he’s got a vibe all his own. Around the family he goes by “MP3,” but Ma Dukes likes to call him “the lawyer,” since he always knows how to argue his point and win a debate. He’s big on baseball and spends a lot of his time on the field, working on his game and getting better every day. When he’s not practicing, you can usually catch him chilling with his controller in hand, locked into whatever game he’s on. Myles is laid-back but focused, and he’s always down for a laugh while still keeping that competitive edge. He’s the type of guy who can make you laugh one second and then beat you in a game the next.</p>
