          <h2>Family Fun Facts</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>The MJ Squad is a close-knit family built on love, energy, and unity. At the heart of the squad is Kenley Marley Myles, whose personality brings light and excitement to those around them. Alongside Kenley is their caring and strong mother, affectionately known as Ma Dukes, who serves as the foundation of the family’s strength and guidance. Their unique name, “MJ Squad,” came from the special bond they share, as each family member has a first name beginning with the letter M and a middle name beginning with the letter J—except for Ma Dukes. Together, they proudly represent not just a family, but a bond full of support, joy, and resilience.</p>

         <p>The bond we share runs deep; we have our ups and downs, but at the end of the day we will always have each other’s back no matter what. Through every challenge and every triumph, our connection only grows stronger. We support, uplift, and motivate one another, creating a foundation built on love and trust. Even when life gets tough, we find a way to come together and push through as a team. This unwavering loyalty and understanding is what makes our relationship truly unbreakable.</p>
