        <main><h2>summer work experience</h2>
            <p>This summer, I worked at a recreation center where I helped supervise and engage with kids. My days were filled with planning fun activities, organizing games, and making sure everyone stayed safe and included. One of the best parts of the job was going on field trips to places like the zoo, water parks, and museums. I got to build strong connections with the kids and watch them grow more confident and social each week. The experience taught me a lot about patience, leadership, and responsibility. Working at the rec center made my summer exciting, meaningful, and full of unforgettable moments.</p>
