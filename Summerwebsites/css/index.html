            <h2>Summer Work Experience</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>This summer, I worked at a recreation center where I helped supervise and engage with kids. My days were filled with planning fun activities, organizing games, and making sure everyone stayed safe and included. One of the best parts of the job was going on field trips to places like the zoo, water parks, and museums. I got to build strong connections with the kids and watch them grow more confident and social each week. The experience taught me a lot about patience, leadership, and responsibility. Working at the rec center made my summer exciting, meaningful, and full of unforgettable moments.</p>

            <p>Above, you can see me having fun with the kids at the recreation center. We had a blast playing games and going on adventures together. The children brought me a lot of joy. Every day was different, whether we were doing arts and crafts, playing sports, or heading out on exciting field trips. I especially loved seeing their faces light up when we visited new places or tried something fun for the first time. This experience not only gave me great memories but also helped me grow as a leader and role model.</p>
